    Always pick last element as pivot
    Pick a random element as pivot.
    Pick median as pivot.

    The key process in quickSort is partition(). Target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of array as
    pivot, put x at its correct position in sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and
    put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time

    """
    Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection
    sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process
    for the remaining elements.

    What is Binary Heap?
    Let us first define a Complete Binary Tree. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level,
    except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible (Source Wikipedia)

    A Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree where items are stored in a special order such that value in a parent node
    is greater(or smaller) than the values in its two children nodes. The former is called as max heap and the latter
    is called min-heap. The heap can be represented by a binary tree or array.

    Why array based representation for Binary Heap?
    Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as an array and the array-based
    representation is space-efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated
    by 2 * I + 1 and right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).
